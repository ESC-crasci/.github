Meet the lab man: Atul.

Hi readers!
My name is Atul and I create electronic devices and projects as a hobby in my free time. When free, I tend to write about the project in my website. (a.k.a this site.). I also make content in YouTube and Twitch. I will very soon be using Utreon as a full distribution platform Aswell. In the past, I have worked with products and components made by Atmel, Microchip, TI, NXP and Raspberry PI. I prefer using the Arduino platform, but I am expanding my platform set too.
Over the past 15 years, I have accumulated a lot of awards as well. 
Want to get in touch with me?
